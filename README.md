# School District Metrics

- Analyze district-wide standardized test results of all students. Data given is students math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools the students attend. With the resulting data, we can better understand individual school performance and needs, and make informed budgetary decisions. 

## Files

[`School Data`](Resources/schools_complete.csv) - Source file for school data.

[`Student Data`](Resources/students_complete.csv) - Source file for student data.

[`PyCitySchools.ipynb`](PyCitySchools.ipynb) - Primary jupyter notebook file to process and aggregate the school and student data. 

## Analysis

- Charter schools have higher reading, math and passing grades than district schools.
- School size impacts students scores once the size is over 2000 students. There doesn't appear to be any advantage is having a school <1000 compared to those with a size between 1000-2000.
- School overall budget didn't have an impact on scores. However, how the budget was distributed, such as teacher salary, or materials, was not broken down. More study/information is needed to understand this aspect.
